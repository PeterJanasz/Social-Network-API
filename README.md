## [Description](#table-of-contents)

The Social Network API is a robust and flexible backend application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB using Mongoose. It provides the foundation for building a social network or community-oriented platform where users can create and manage thoughts, reactions, and friends.

## [Features](#features)
**Thought Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete thoughts. Each thought can have associated reactions, offering a way for users to engage with one another's thoughts.

- **User Profiles**: Users can create and manage their profiles. They can also add and remove friends from their friend list.

- **RESTful API**: The application follows a RESTful API design, making it easy to interact with and integrate into other applications or front-end frameworks.

## [Key Components](#key-components) 

**Express Server**: The core of the application is an Express.js server, which listens for incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate handlers.

- **Mongoose Models**: The application uses Mongoose schemas and models to interact with a MongoDB database. It enables structured data storage and retrieval.

- **Middleware**: Middleware functions are used to handle requests and responses, validate data, authenticate users, and more. They are instrumental in the request-response cycle.

- **Route Definitions**: Routes are defined for thoughts and users. These routes specify the endpoints for various CRUD operations and user interactions.
